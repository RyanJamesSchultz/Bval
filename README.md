# Bval

We present a Matlab-based routine, Bval that calculates the fit to the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude distribution (GR-FMD).  This code could be readily adapted or modified for a broad range of seismological applications.

For sample use see "script_plot.m" and "script_Mc" to recreate the supplementary figure 8 within the corresponding manuscript (Schultz et al., 2018).
